Her friends tell her that she just \"hasn't met the one yet,\" but Chika has doubts... It's only when Chika enters college and meets peers like herself that she realizes there's a word for what she feels inside--asexual--and she's not the only one. After years of wondering if love was the answer, Chika realizes that the answer she long sought may not exist at all--and that that's perfectly normal.",

Then, one night, as he’s searching for his next bite of monster meat, a red-haired woman shouldering a greatsword appears before him and says to him, “You have promise. Become my apprentice.” How is he supposed to tell her that this must be some sort of mistake? But there’s a secret that only she knows, and that he’s stumbled upon: eating monsters makes you stronger! With her training and his newfound power, Mars will finally overcome all those pesky assassination attempts. However, that doesn’t end things; no, it’s only the beginning of a nationwide—even continent-spanning—series of wars and plots with him right in the middle!",

Then, one day, a ravishing college student she's never met before gives her a present while she's working. Her coworkers are ecstatic, but the rational Ranko doesn't know what to make of it. At home, she's met with another surprise. Apparently, someone from the Chonabashi family wants to marry Ranko! It seems as though their grandfathers made a pact to have their grandchildren marry each other one day. Ranko declines, as she enjoys working and isn't interested in marriage, but her parents won't have it. She rather unwillingly goes to the Chonabashi residence to please her parents and protect their egos. When she gets there, who does she see but Yoichiro, the unfriendly young man who gave her that present at the cafe!",

Having gotten similar feedback on her own manga, Miyamoto proposes she and Uehara engage in a fake relationship, since neither of them has any romantic experience. But Miyamoto is far from the perfect heroine Uehara's concocted, and he isn't the cocky hero from her story either. Can their relationship turn their manga dreams into reality, or will it lead to even more comic disasters?",

He’s your typical ‘perfect guy’ in every sense; the protagonist with no real flaws that you see in any given story. Life at school was going on as usual… until one day Haruma’s super popular little sister confesses to me out of the blue?! Though she later clarifies that her feelings toward me are anything but romantic and that she has an ulterior motive, I end up accepting my new role as ‘fake boyfriend’ as a favor to Haruma. Believe it or not, the moment I start going out with her, Haruma’s idol-tier childhood friend and my super hot teacher get involved with me too! Wait a minute, this can’t be a dream rom-com scenario setting itself up for me, can it?! I mean, there’s no way a side character like me could be popular, right?",

Then, at their very first meeting, Takaharu pops the question out of nowhere...!

Despite starting on such a mercenary note, their newlywed life sees Shizuku developing deeper feelings for the calm and gentle Takaharu. At the same time, though, the way he always maintains a polite distance and never even tries to touch her leaves Shizuku full of doubt...!! Meanwhile, Takaharu is closely guarding certain hidden feelings of his own... Letting the right moment for a wedding night slip past them was just the start of the hectic, heart-pounding romance for this adorably unfortunate fledgling couple.",
